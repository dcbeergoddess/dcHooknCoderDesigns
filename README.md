## Description

Beginnings of CRUD App for my craft yarn projects and more. First instance of the application to is showcase crochet and knit projects I have finished based of other people's patterns and allow users to comment. 

Next up is to create an inventory page for all my yarn in stock. 

Eventually I will allow others to add their own projects and have their own project page.
